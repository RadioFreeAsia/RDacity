This is a quick overview of compiling the Audacity For Rivendell software
in a Linux environment.

Each Linux environment is different - build the configuration steps attempts to ensure that 
you have all the correct libraries before you can make the software.

You will need all the development tools and libraries (autoconf, C compiler, etc...)
that are generally needed to compile and build software. See your distribution's suggerstions
and install those seperately.

You will need to install several library packages:

   1)  Mysql  (including the development library)
   2)  LibCurl
   3)  Expat


After installing the above libraries you will need the rivendell-c-api library.  
You can download that at github.com/RadioFreeAsia/rivendell-c-api.

You need to configure and make that software.  
You will need to make install as root the rivendell-c-api library as well.

After that you will need to follow the direction for compiling Audacity (i.e. Build WXWIDGETS,
set up LD Environment if applicable).

I used the following commands when building RDacity the last time after downloading:

  1)  autoreconf -i (from the RDacity directory).
  2)  configure --without-lv2  (my lv2 project would not make for some reason).
  3)  make



If you run into problems finding the mysql libraries - check that you have mysql development
libs installed.  If it doesn't find the rivendell-c-api check that it is installed.  Also
the make sure that the environment variable  PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set to include /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.
That's where the rivendell configuration lives for the api and it wont find it otherwise.
